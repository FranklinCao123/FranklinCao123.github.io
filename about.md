# üí¨ Introduction
---

I enrolled at Fudan University in 2018, initially in the Department of Electronic Engineering, where I acquired foundational programming skills in languages such as Python, C, and others, along with hands-on experience in analog and digital circuit design.
In 2020, I transferred to the Department of Physics and earned my B.Sc. in 2023, with a strong foundation in theoretical physics and computational methods, including quantum field theory, group theory, and the Standard Model.
I am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in theoretical physics (high energy physics) at the Department of Physics, Fudan University. My research focuses on particle physics phenomenology, with interests in:
- Positivity bounds in particle physics phenomenology 
- Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics at future colliders  
- Applications of machine learning in BSM searches  
- Effective Field Theory
